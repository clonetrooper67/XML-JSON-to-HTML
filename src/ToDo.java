// Need to handle "UNKNOWN_ERROR" messages and output it to a txt file for debugging. 
// Currently the urls that are being sent to the API shouldn't be causing this error.

// If there is an address that has an error write the address to a text file.

// Clean up the code at some point

//Maybe make the program retry sending an address that gets  a 500 error
